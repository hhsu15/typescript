# typescript

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g typescript ts-node

tsc --help  # typescript compiler
```

```bash
npm init -y  # create npm package without asking questions

```

To run the compiler

```bash
tsc index.ts  # will ceate a file called index.js
node index.js  # then you can run with node

```

Of course this is better, does above in one line.

```bash
ts-node index.ts

```
